# CEEN_514
This repository will contain the associated files with my CEEN 514 Project

I hope to learn some specific things in this class. I hope to learn how to share projects online using GitHub. I also would like to learn how to properly create a Tethys application.
I am excited to learn new programming concepts and solidify my understanding with the python code language.
I also want to be able to learn more about licenses and the proper way to license a project like this taking into consideration all the different types of data available.

Earthquake mapper -MOTUS
- This app will be able to display the earthquakes in certain regions, it will also display the faults and the UAV data related to these places.
- This app will be able to zoom in and show some specific information about the earthquakes and faults.
- there will be an option to upload pictures or other links that may be related to these disasters.
