I hope to learn some specific things in this class. I hope to learn how to share projects online using GitHub. I also would like to learn how to properly create a Tethys application.
I am excited to learn new programming concepts and solidify my understanding with the python code language.
I also want to be able to learn more about licenses and the proper way to license a project like this taking into consideration all the different types of data available.
